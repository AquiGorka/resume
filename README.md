## Flagship Projects, Achievements & Notes
> Puppets

Ever wondered how a 3D virtual puppet would look like in a browser? Even better, can you imagine if you could remote control it by moving your smartphone? This is my latest pet project and part of my dream of producing video games.

> Ruta Mendoza and Mendoza Wineries

I travelled 3 months all around Mendoza and created a Mobile Guide and a Winery Guide for the province. The projects entered international contests such as “Best of Wine Tourism” from Great Wine Capitals Global Network. It fills me with pride that the Tourism Ministry of Mendoza acknowledged my projects and spoke very highly of them.

> TrotaMexico

I took on the project of travelling 2 years through my home country (Mexico) in an effort to develop an online portal that promoted touristic destinations in the country through a cultural and natural approach. I received a journalism award and was invited to give 3 talks at the Mexican International Tourism Fair of 2010 for this project. During this time I was required to negotiate with different governmental and private institutions and companies. This project receives visitors from all over the world thanks to more than 54,000 combinations of keywords that rank the website in the top spots.

> Project Management

Within all these years I have been involved with all the different aspects of project management. Consequently I have acquired a kin sense of organization and a detailed manner of planning for current and/or future projects. I have experience in all the areas around software projects: client negotiation, requirement gathering, idea brainstorming, analysis, planning, development, implementation, testing, project follow-up, project reengineering, documentation and project assessment. I bring my experience to the teams I work with and always look for ways to improve myself.

> Leadership

I have had the pleasure of working with a lot of people, in some cases I took on the role of team leader. As such, I have had to analyze the requirements of projects and distribute the different tasks among the team members accordingly to their skill sets. As a leader, I always try to motivate people to achieve their goals (both work related and personal). I also try to get to know the people I work with, in order to understand better how they can improve themselves and how they can be of better use for the projects.
